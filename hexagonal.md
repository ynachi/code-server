User: 
I am developping a flask application to create load balancers. The users will have access to a rest api to create those loadbalancers. I am following haxagonal architecture (service, adapter, port or interface, ...). I use flask and sqlalchemy as ORM. Please help step by step to build it togeter. We will implement evexything including testing. I rely on an external API to create loadbalances. Lets call they SDK lbaas-sdk.

Assistant: 
Sure, I'd be happy to help you develop your Flask application to create load balancers. First, let's outline a high-level plan for setting up this project.

1. **Setting Up Your Environment**: Depending on your development environment, you'll want to make sure you have Python 3.10, pip and virtualenv installed. Then, we will create a virtual environment and install Flask and SQLAlchemy. Here's a comprehensive guide on [how to set up python environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

2. **Project Structure Setup**: We will set up the project structure based on hexagonal architecture. Here is a basic example of how the structure might look:

```
myapp/
    myapp/
        __init__.py
        adapters/
            __init__.py
            http/
                __init__.py
        application/
            __init__.py
        domain/
            __init__.py
            services/
                __init__.py
                load_balancer_service.py
        infrastructure/
            __init__.py
            persistence/
                __init__.py
                models/
                    __init__.py
                    load_balancer.py
                db.py
        tests/
            __init__.py
    main.py
```
3. **Application Initialization**: We will then create our Flask app in `main.py` and initialize SQLAlchemy.

4. **Database Model Creation**: In `infrastructure/persistence/models/load_balancer.py`, we will define our database model (LoadBalancer).

5. **Repository Creation**: In `infrastructure/persistence/`, we will create `load_balancer_repository.py` based on `load_balancer.py`.

6. **Services Creation**: In `domain/services/load_balancer_service.py`, we implement the business logic by utilizing the methods from `load_balancer_repository.py`.

7. **API Endpoints Creation**: In `adapters/http/`, we will create `load_balancer_api.py` where we define API endpoints and use `load_balancer_service.py` methods for handling business logic. 

8. **Testing**: We will write unit tests using pytest for all created modules.

This is a basic high-level approach. The complexity of the application may require adjustments and additions.

Let's get started and each step will be implemented in a more concrete way.
Does this work for you?

User: 
Let's start with the domain models and data base models. Let's imagine the LB need an ID and name.

Assistant: 
Great, let's start by creating the Database and Domain models. These models will represent a Load Balancer in our application. 

Given that a Load Balancer needs an ID and a name, we can create a SQLAlchemy model as follows:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class LoadBalancer(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'load_balancers'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
```

This model is defined in `myapp/infrastructure/persistence/models/load_balancer.py`. It represents the `load_balancers` table in your database, which has two columns: `id` and `name`. The `id` column is the primary key.

In a similar fashion, we also need to define a Domain model for the Load Balancer. This could be a simple Python class:

```python
class LoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
```

This domain model should be defined in `myapp/domain/load_balancer.py`. It will be used to represent a Load Balancer in the context of business logic and operations.

Please keep in mind that usually, you would also include methods that operate on the models as part of your domain model (also known as entity). However, for the sake of simplicity, we're just defining the object structure here.

Next step would be to implement the repository which will interface the database operations with these models. Would you like to proceed with that?

User: 
Please add associated servers field to the LB. It will have IDs of servers it will be using as backend.

Assistant: 
Adding associated servers to the LoadBalancer model involves establishing a relationship between LoadBalancer and Server models. Let's assume that a Server model represents a backend server and is identified by an `id`.

Here's an updated version of the LoadBalancer model in `myapp/infrastructure/persistence/models/load_balancer.py`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, relationship

Base = declarative_base()

class Server(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'servers'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    # include additional columns as needed

class LoadBalancer(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'load_balancers'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

    # Establish a relationship with the Server table
    servers = relationship("Server",
                  secondary="loadbalancer_servers",  # refers to linking table
                  backref="loadbalancers")


class LoadBalancerServer(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'loadbalancer_servers'
    loadbalancer_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('load_balancers.id'), primary_key=True)
    server_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('servers.id'), primary_key=True)
```

This SQLAlchemy model now has a many-to-many relationship with the Server table, through a "linking" table `LoadBalancerServer`. The `servers` variable holds the relationship.

And for the domain model:

```python
class Server:
  def __init__(self, id):
    self.id = id 

class LoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, id, name, servers):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.servers = servers  # list of Server objects
```

These domain models are for the backend to use in business logic and operations, and will now also be aware of the associated servers of each Load Balancer.

Remember to validate these updates with your business requirements. Next, we can implement the repository for handling database operations. Would you like to proceed?

User: 
Ok to create a loadbalancer, we implement the business logic into service. The plan is to not call the external LB API directly but use interfaces. Let's implement the core business logic. We take some parameters (name and servers), we validate that the name and servers are good as paremeter, we make an api call ia the interface, and we store the details of the created LB in the database. Again, to avoid tigh coupling, we don't call the DB directly 

Assistant: 
Absolutely, to respect the hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters), we create a repository interface for the database and a port for the external API call. The work of the service will be to use these interfaces and ports so it is not tightly coupled with the database or the external API.

Let's start within the `myapp/domain/services/load_balancer_service.py` file:

```python
class LoadBalancerService:
    def __init__(self, lb_repository, lb_api):
        self.lb_repository = lb_repository
        self.lb_api = lb_api

    def create_load_balancer(self, name, servers):
        # Validate the parameters
        if not name:
            raise ValueError("Load balancer name is missing")
        
        if not servers or not isinstance(servers, list):
            raise ValueError("Invalid servers list")
            
        # Check if a LoadBalancer of same name already exists
        if self.lb_repository.find_by_name(name):
            raise ValueError("Load balancer with this name already exists")

        # Make the API call via the interface
        api_response = self.lb_api.create_load_balancer(name, servers)

        # Create LoadBalancer domain object
        lb = LoadBalancer(api_response['id'], name, servers)

        # Store the load balancer in DB
        self.lb_repository.save(lb)
```

Here, we've created a `LoadBalancerService` class with a method `create_load_balancer` that follows the steps you've mentioned.

1. It validates the name and servers.
2. Checks if a load balancer with the same name already exists using the lb_repository interface.
3. If no LB with the same name exists, it uses the lb_api interface to make a call to the external API.
4. It creates a LoadBalancer domain object from the API response.
5. And finally, it stores the created LB into the database using the lb_repository interface.

The interfaces `lb_repository` and `lb_api` do not directly connect with the DB or make API calls, they are just interfaces that are injected into the service. The actual implementation connecting to the DB and making API calls will be in adapters layer.

We've handled the exceptions where the name or servers are missing, and also where a load balancer with the same name already exists by raising a ValueError. You can handle these exceptions on a high level as per your need.

Next steps would be to implement the `lb_repository` and `lb_api` interfaces under the infrastructure and adapters layer respectively. Would you like to proceed with that?

User: 
`create_load_balancer` in service class should return a LB domain model right ?

Assistant: 
Yes, returning the created Load Balancer as a domain model allows for further manipulation or checks if required. Let's modify `create_load_balancer` function to return the LB:

```python
def create_load_balancer(self, name, servers):
    # Validate the parameters
    if not name:
        raise ValueError("Load balancer name is missing")
        
    if not servers or not isinstance(servers, list):
        raise ValueError("Invalid servers list")
        
    # Check if a LoadBalancer of same name already exists
    if self.lb_repository.find_by_name(name):
        raise ValueError("Load balancer with this name already exists")

    # Make the API call via the interface
    api_response = self.lb_api.create_load_balancer(name, servers)

    # Create LoadBalancer domain object
    lb = LoadBalancer(api_response['id'], name, servers)

    # Store the load balancer in DB
    self.lb_repository.save(lb)

    # return the created LoadBalancer
    return lb
```

The final `return lb` statement will return the newly created Load Balancer after it has been saved in the database. The callers of this function can now access the data of the newly created Load Balancer directly. 

Now, I think we can proceed with implementing the `lb_repository` and `lb_api` interfaces. Would you like to go to the next step?

User: 
Let's write some tests for the service first. We should test the core logic using mocking. We will create the lb_repositor after that.

Assistant: 
Sure, writing unit tests is an essential part of software development. Let's write some tests for the `create_load_balancer` method of the `LoadBalancerService` class. We'll use pytest and the unittest.mock library for this. 

Remember to place the test files in the `tests/` directory of your project.

Here's an example of how to setup a basic test in a file like `myapp/tests/test_load_balancer_service.py`:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from myapp.domain.services.load_balancer_service import LoadBalancerService

def test_create_load_balancer():
    lb_repository_mock = MagicMock()
    lb_api_mock = MagicMock()

    # Mock the response from the Load Balancer API
    lb_api_mock.create_load_balancer.return_value = {'id': 1, 'name': 'test_lb', 'servers': [1, 2, 3]}

    lb_service = LoadBalancerService(lb_repository_mock, lb_api_mock)

    # Call the method we want to test
    result = lb_service.create_load_balancer('test_lb', [1, 2, 3])

    # Check that the API was called with the correct arguments
    lb_api_mock.create_load_balancer.assert_called_once_with('test_lb', [1, 2, 3])

    # Check that the repository's save method was called
    lb_repository_mock.save.assert_called_once()

    # Check that the result is as expected
    assert result.id == 1
    assert result.name == 'test_lb'
    assert result.servers == [1, 2, 3]

```

This test creates mocks for the `lb_repository` and `lb_api` dependencies of `LoadBalancerService`, and then checks that all interactions with these dependencies happen as expected when `create_load_balancer` is called.

Remember to run the tests with the pytest command in your terminal:

```bash
pytest
```

After your tests are passing, we would be ready to implement the `lb_repository` interface next. Would you want to proceed with that?

User: 
Ok I see that you only check if the repository save method was called. So I guess we don't need to test wether it was saved or not right ? Because this part will be tested when implementing repository, right ?

Assistant: 
Yes, you're absolutely correct.

When writing unit tests, you're essentially testing each component of the software in isolation. This means that when testing your `LoadBalancerService` class, you're really only interested in testing its own behavior - not the behavior of services it interacts with, like the repository or the API client.

You mock the interactions with these services so that you can control their behavior during tests, and remove any dependency on their actual implementation. This allows you to focus on testing the behavior of `LoadBalancerService` in response to different conditions.

When we test the `save` method of the `lb_repository`, we will be validating whether or not it's saving to the database correctly. That is a separate concern and should be addressed in a different set of unit tests specifically designed for the repository. 

The benefits of this approach are that you decouple your tests from one another, and the failure of one test doesn't cause cascading failures in other unrelated tests, making it easier to track down and fix problems. 

So the behavior of the `save` method itself will indeed be tested when we implement and test the repository.

I hope this explanation cleared up your doubt. Can we move forward now?

User: 
ok lastly for the testing part, we need to be sure that the servers given IDs exist and are in OK status. As we cannot associate a non ok server to a LB. How can this test be taken into account ?

Assistant: 
Good point! Verifying servers' ids and status is crucial. 

To accomplish this, you may want to include a `server_repository` or `server_service` that has methods for checking server existence and status. 

But for testing this logic within the `LoadBalancerService`, you can mock the external calls that check server existence and status. If the function checking server status raises an exception for invalid servers, you can simulate this in your tests as well.

Below, we've adjusted the test to simulate a server that does not exist:

```python
def test_create_load_balancer_with_nonexistent_server():
    lb_repository_mock = MagicMock()
    lb_api_mock = MagicMock()
    server_repository_mock = MagicMock()

    # Assume the server_repository's check_servers_exist method raises an exception for nonexistent servers
    server_repository_mock.check_servers_exist.side_effect = ValueError("Server does not exist")

    lb_service = LoadBalancerService(lb_repository_mock, lb_api_mock, server_repository_mock)

    # Call the method we want to test and expect it to raise an exception
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as e:
        lb_service.create_load_balancer('test_lb', [999])  # using 999 as a nonexistent server id

    assert str(e.value) == "Server does not exist"
    
    # The API method should not have been called since the servers don't exist
    lb_api_mock.create_load_balancer.assert_not_called()
    
    # The repository's save method should not have been called since the servers don't exist
    lb_repository_mock.save.assert_not_called()
```

This testcase simulates a scenario where one of the server ids does not exist. The `check_servers_exist` function is expected to raise a `ValueError` when it encounters a server id that does not exist. The `create_load_balancer` function should not call the `create_load_balancer` method on the API client or the `save` method on the repository. The assert statement at the end verifies this.
  
For the OK status of a server, you can add similar logic and test to ensure only servers with OK status are added.

Does this provide a clear direction on how to write your tests?

User: 
good! Let's now move to the repository

Assistant: 
Excellent! Let's move on to the `lb_repository` then.

The `lb_repository` interface abstracts the storage layer used by your application. You can use a variety of storage systems (like a relational database, a NoSQL database or a simple in-memory database) without changing the rest of the application's code.

Let's start by defining the interface in a file like `myapp/domain/repositories/load_balancer_repository.py`:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class LoadBalancerRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, load_balancer):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def find_by_id(self, id):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def find_by_name(self, name):
        pass
```

This is defining the basic shape of your repository with methods to save a Load Balancer and find Load Balancers by their id or name. All the methods are declared with the `@abstractmethod` decorator to make sure they are implemented in any concrete classes that inherit from this interface.

For a concrete implementation, you would need to decide what database you will be using in your project. How entries are saved and searched will depend on the actual database technology used.

Remember not to add any business logic into the repository. It should only contain direct interactions with the database.

Could you please confirm the database you're planning to use for this project, so we can help with more specific examples on implementing `lb_repository` interface?

User: 
It will be a SQL based database. 

Assistant: 
Understood! In this case, you'll probably use a library like SQLAlchemy to interact with your database. Below is a basic implementation of the LoadBalancerRepository using SQLAlchemy:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from myapp.domain.models import LoadBalancer

class LoadBalancerRepositorySQLAlchemy:
    def __init__(self, session: Session):
        self.session = session

    def save(self, load_balancer):
        self.session.add(load_balancer)
        self.session.commit()

    def find_by_id(self, id):
        return self.session.query(LoadBalancer).get(id)

    def find_by_name(self, name):
        return self.session.query(LoadBalancer).filter_by(name=name).first()
```

This `LoadBalancerRepositorySQLAlchemy` class uses SQLAlchemy's `session` to interact with the database. The `save()` method adds the `LoadBalancer` instance to the session and commits the transaction. The `find_by_id()` and `find_by_name()` methods use the session's `query` method to execute SELECT queries against the database.

Please note that this is a very basic SQLAlchemy-based repository. Depending on your project's requirements, you might want to enhance this repository with more advanced features (like exception handling, support for transactions, logging, etc.), or introduce a Unit of Work.

Just replace `myapp.domain.models` with your actual path to LoadBalancer model. Also make sure to add the required database fields to your LoadBalancer model and reflect them to the database.

Use your application's starting point to instantiate a `Session` with the proper configuration, and provide it when you instantiate `LoadBalancerRepositorySQLAlchemy`. Then provide this repository instance to `LoadBalancerService`.

This is a very basic implementation of how an SQLAlchemy repository might look. Be sure to also write tests for these methods, similar to what we discussed before. You can use libraries like `pytest-mock` to replace `session` with a Mock object.

Does this help? Do you have any questions or need further assistance?

User: 
How does this repository interract with DB models ?

Assistant: 
Great question! In SQLAlchemy, which is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), you work with Python classes (models) that are mapped to tables in the database. These classes define the schema of the table they're mapped to, including the column names, data types etc.

To illustrate, suppose you have a `LoadBalancer` model in the file `myapp/domain/models.py` which looks like this:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class LoadBalancer(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'load_balancers'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    servers = Column(String)  # Assuming servers are stored as a comma-separated string
```

These classes (models) map to actual tables in your database with the specified columns. When you create an instance of the class and commit the session, a new row gets added to the corresponding table.

Your repository interacts with these models through SQLAlchemy sessions. A `Session` in SQLAlchemy manages all conversations with the database. You use the `Session` to query your database and to persist new objects to your database.

In the `save` method of the repository, you add the `LoadBalancer` instance to the current session and commit the session to persist the new `LoadBalancer` to the database.

When you query the database as in `find_by_id` or `find_by_name` methods, SQLAlchemy returns instances of your `LoadBalancer` model corresponding to the rows in the `load_balancers` table meeting the criteria of your query.

That's how your repository is able to interact with the database using models. The ORM (in this case SQLAlchemy) abstracts away much of the SQL and lets you interact with your database in an object-oriented manner.

I hope this clarifies your question. Is there anything else you would like to know?

User: 
So does it mean we use the same model as DB model and domain model ?

Assistant: 
Yes, you're correct. In many applications, particularly those using ORMs like SQLAlchemy, the same models are used for both the domain and the database. These models embody the data structures used in the application, providing a single source of truth for how data is structured.

This approach simplifies the architecture and allows you to focus on developing the business logic, but has some potential drawbacks, including:

- *Coupling*: Because your domain is tied to your database structure, changes in one may necessitate changes in the other. Over time, this can make the architecture less flexible and harder to maintain.
- *Leaky abstractions*: Details about the database (like a specific type of join, or indexing behavior) may leak into the domain, leading to business logic that's intertwined with database-specific details.

There are architectural patterns such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD) where the business/domain models are separated from the persistence models, and a mapping layer is introduced between them. In this architecture, you would maintain separate classes for your domain models and database models. This decouples the business logic from the database and makes the domain more business-focused, which offers more flexibility but adds complexity and can be overkill for simpler applications.

In your case, unless you have specific needs that push you towards a decoupled DDD-style architecture, using the same model for both the domain and database (as in the SQLAlchemy example) will likely be the most straightforward route. It's a common and effective pattern in many Python apps.

User: 
No, I have a requiment to separate models. This is the policy of our company. Please update the code to match that.

Assistant: 
I see. In this scenario, we would create separate model classes for domain and data access layer (DAL). In the DAL, we will have classes corresponding to SQL tables.

Let's start by defining our `LoadBalancer` domain model in the `myapp/domain/models.py` file. This would differ from the SQLAlchemy model:

```python
class LoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, id, name, servers):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.servers = servers
```

Next, let's define our `LoadBalancer` SQL model for SQLAlchemy in `myapp/dal/models.py`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class LoadBalancerSQLModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'load_balancers'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    servers = Column(String)  # Assuming servers are stored as a comma-separated string
```

Now, let's update the `LoadBalancerRepositorySQLAlchemy` class to use these two independent models:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from myapp.domain.models import LoadBalancer
from myapp.dal.models import LoadBalancerSQLModel

class LoadBalancerRepositorySQLAlchemy:
    def __init__(self, session: Session):
        self.session = session

    def save(self, load_balancer: LoadBalancer):
        lb_sql = LoadBalancerSQLModel(id=load_balancer.id, name=load_balancer.name, servers=load_balancer.servers)
        self.session.add(lb_sql)
        self.session.commit()

    def find_by_id(self, id):
        lb_sql = self.session.query(LoadBalancerSQLModel).get(id)
        return None if lb_sql is None else LoadBalancer(id=lb_sql.id, name=lb_sql.name, servers=lb_sql.servers)

    def find_by_name(self, name):
        lb_sql = self.session.query(LoadBalancerSQLModel).filter_by(name=name).first()
        return None if lb_sql is None else LoadBalancer(id=lb_sql.id, name=lb_sql.name, servers=lb_sql.servers)
```

The `save` method now creates an instance of `LoadBalancerSQLModel` from the domain model before adding it to the session. The `find_*` methods convert the retrieved `LoadBalancerSQLModel` instances back into domain model instances.

This approach ensures separation between your domain and data access models. This allows for flexibility and prevents the domain layer from being tightly coupled with the database layer.

Remember to update your tests accordingly to work with this updated design.

Keep in mind that as your application grows, you might want to introduce a mapping layer or use a tool like a Data Mapper pattern to simplify and manage these conversions between domain and data models.

Let me know if there are further aspects you want us to elaborate on or if there are more questions we can assist you with!

User: 
Let's say my LB has 10 fields. It can be a little coumbersome to do it this way right ?

Assistant: 
That's a good point! When an object has a large number of fields, this approach can indeed get a bit cumbersome. In such a situation, using a mapping library or even creating your own mapping utility functions or classes can be very beneficial. 

A popular library you might want to look at is `marshmallow`. Marshmallow is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex Python data types, such as objects, to and from Python data types (dictionaries, lists). 

Let me show you a brief example of how you could simplify this using a Mapper class and Python's built-in `__dict__` method:

```python
class LoadBalancerMapper:

    @staticmethod
    def to_sql_model(load_balancer):
        return LoadBalancerSQLModel(**load_balancer.__dict__)
    
    @staticmethod
    def to_domain_model(lb_sql):
        return LoadBalancer(**lb_sql.__dict__)
```

And how you would use this in your repository:

```python
class LoadBalancerRepositorySQLAlchemy:

    def save(self, load_balancer: LoadBalancer):
        lb_sql = LoadBalancerMapper.to_sql_model(load_balancer)
        self.session.add(lb_sql)
        self.session.commit()

    def find_by_id(self, id):
        lb_sql = self.session.query(LoadBalancerSQLModel).get(id)
        return None if lb_sql is None else LoadBalancerMapper.to_domain_model(lb_sql)

    def find_by_name(self, name):
        lb_sql = self.session.query(LoadBalancerSQLModel).filter_by(name=name).first()
        return None if lb_sql is None else LoadBalancerMapper.to_domain_model(lb_sql)
```

In the mapper, we use the `__dict__` method which returns a dictionary with an object's instance attributes. This way, you can convert between your models without having to specify each attribute individually. Please be aware that `__dict__` does not return attributes which are properties, methods, or attributes of the class rather than the instance. In this case, you may want to use other libraries such as `marshal`, `pickle`, or the aforementioned `marshmallow` depending on your needs.

User: 
Where do this mapper stay in the architecture ?

Assistant: 
The mapper's location would typically depend on your project's directory structure and convention, but it is generally located within the data access layer or a separate layer/directory dedicated for mappers or "serializers" in your project.

For a typical layered architecture, you can create a `mappers` or `serializers` directory at the same level as your `domain` and `dal` directories. It could look something like this:

```
myapp/
    domain/
        __init__.py
        models.py
    dal/
        __init__.py
        models.py
        repositories.py
    mappers/
        __init__.py
        load_balancer_mapper.py
    services.py
``` 

In this structure, `load_balancer_mapper.py` would contain the `LoadBalancerMapper` class which will be responsible for converting between domain and DAL models.

This allows you to isolate the responsibility of data conversions in a single, dedicated place. The mappers can be used anywhere in the project where such conversions are required, ensuring a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach and promoting separation of concerns in your code-base.

Remember though, this is just a suggested structure. The actual location and name of the directory may depend on your project's size, conventions, or your team's preference. The most important thing is to keep the structure consistent, logical and easy to navigate for developers.

User: 
lastly, in the service code, you validated the inputs one by one. Let's say we need to pass 5 fields to create a LB. It can be coumbersome to validate one by one. Can we use a dataclass we can validate one shot? Is it a good idea ? I am not an experienced backend developer

Assistant: 
Absolutely. In Python, dataclasses are a great way to simplify data handling and they can certainly be used in combination with a validation library to validate fields all at once. 

One popular library for input validation is `pydantic`. Pydantic models (inspired by dataclasses) allow for easy validation of more complex user input.

Consider the following example as an enhancement to your existing code:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic import validator

class LoadBalancerCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    servers: str

    @validator('name')
    def name_must_be_valid(cls, v):
        if not v.isalnum():
            raise ValueError('Name must be alphanumeric')
        return v

    @validator('servers')
    def servers_must_be_valid(cls, v):
        servers = v.split(",")
        if not all(s.isalnum() for s in servers):
            raise ValueError('Servers list must contain only alphanumeric server names')
        return v
```

`LoadBalancerCreate` is a Pydantic model that takes care of validation. `validator` decorator is used to add custom checks. You can then use this class in your service:

```python
from myapp.domain.models import LoadBalancer
from myapp.domain.repositories import LoadBalancerRepository

class LoadBalancerService:
    def __init__(self, repository: LoadBalancerRepository):
        self.repository = repository

    def create_lb(self, lb: LoadBalancerCreate):
        self.repository.save(LoadBalancer(id=None, name=lb.name, servers=lb.servers))

    def get_by_id(self, lb_id: int):
        return self.repository.find_by_id(lb_id)

    def get_by_name(self, lb_name: str):
        return self.repository.find_by_name(lb_name)
```

Since the validation is now handled by the `LoadBalancerCreate` Pydantic model, the `create_lb` function in your Service no longer needs to validate the input - it's done automatically when the `LoadBalancerCreate` object is created.

This leads to cleaner code in your Services, and also you can reuse the `LoadBalancerCreate` dataclass wherever you need to accept these inputs, ensuring consistent validation.

Please note, Pydantic library needs to be installed for this to work. If it's not installed, install it with pip:

```bash
pip install pydantic
```

I hope this helps, let me know if you have any further questions!

User: 
I did not talk about it but server is another object. For now, I suggestd to use they IDs in the LB object. Do you think we should use real servers object as LB field or just the ID as we did ?

Assistant: 
The decision between using server objects directly in the `LoadBalancer` object or just referencing them by their IDs depends largely on the specifics of your use case and how your application is structured.

Using server IDs can keep your `LoadBalancer` object lightweight and avoid duplicate data, particularly in situations where server objects are large or where a server can be associated with many load balancers.

However, there are situations where having the full server objects embedded in the `LoadBalancer` object can be beneficial. For example:

- If server information is frequently accessed alongside load balancer information, having the server objects embedded can reduce the number of database queries your application needs to make.
- If the server objects are small and don't change often, embedding them can help reduce complexity in your code by allowing you to work with complete objects rather than having to look up server information whenever it's needed.
- If your application uses an in-memory database or a NoSQL database that supports nested structures well, embedding can be a natural fit.

If you choose to use server IDs in your `LoadBalancer` objects, you will likely want to provide a service method or repository method that can retrieve the full server objects when needed.

As with many design decisions, there are trade-offs with each approach, and the best choice depends on your specific situation. In general, starting with the simplest design that meets your current needs (such as using server IDs) and then refactoring as necessary as your application grows more complex is often a good strategy.

User: 
For the pydantic validation, if we put some typing, it can automatically validate right ? We don't need to check each field ?

Assistant: 
Yes, that's correct. One of the key benefits of Pydantic is automatic data validation based on Python type annotations. 

Pydantic will automatically validate fields and ensure that the data assigned to them matches the type annotations. If a field is annotated as `str`, Pydantic will ensure that it is indeed a string. Similarly for `int`, `list`, and more complex types. 

The `validator` decorator is used for more complex or custom validation rules that cannot be expressed through type annotations alone.

Here's how you can define a Pydantic model with type annotations:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Server(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

class LoadBalancer(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    servers: List[Server]
```

In this example, Pydantic will automatically ensure that `id` and `name` in both models are integers and strings, respectively. Similarly, it will ensure that `servers` is a list of `Server` objects. If data that doesn't match these type annotations is provided, Pydantic will raise a `ValidationError`.

Remember that Pydantic does not only check that the type of the input matches the type annotations, but also attempts to cast input data to the declared types. For example, if you declare `id: int` and you provide `"123"` as a value, Pydantic will cast it to `123` and not raise an exception.

Despite this, it can be useful to still have custom validation for specific fields with the `validator` decorator for more complex validations that type hints can't express, such as ensuring that a string is not empty or that an integer is within a certain range.

Let me know if you need further clarification or if you have more questions!

User: 
ok can we mix ? Because I would like to take this opportunity to see if the provide servers actually exist and are OK 

Assistant: 
Yes, absolutely! That's exactly where Pydantic shines - you can use type annotations for a lot of the automatic validation and also add custom validators for more complex or specific checks.

In your scenario, assuming that you have a `ServerRepository` to find servers by their IDs, here is an example of how this could work:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
from typing import List, Optional
from myapp.domain.repositories import ServerRepository

class Server(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

class LoadBalancerCreate(BaseModel):   # Change the class name based on your application design
    name: str
    server_ids: List[str]  # Assuming server_ids are strings here

    @validator('server_ids', each_item=True)  # 'each_item=True' means the validator will be run on each item of the list
    def servers_must_exist(cls, server_id):
        server_repo = ServerRepository()
        server = server_repo.get_by_id(server_id)
        if server is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Server with id {server_id} does not exist")
        return server_id
```

In this code, `validator` decorator is used to add a check on the `server_ids` field. For every server ID in `server_ids`, it uses the `ServerRepository` to check if a server with that ID exists. If it doesn't, a `ValueError` is thrown.

Note that in the decorator, we're passing `each_item=True` to make sure that the validator function is applied to each item of the list individually.

One thing to be careful of, though, is to avoid slow or potentially failing operations (like a database lookup) in a validator if it's going to be called very frequently, as this can slow down your application. If this is the case, you may want to employ caching or other strategies to improve performance.

Remember that you need to handle exceptions properly in your program, because Pydantic will raise `ValidationError` when validation fails.

User: 
can we reuse the returned server_id in `servers_must_exist` ?

Assistant: 
No, a `validator` function in Pydantic doesn't directly allow you to pass the validated and possibly transformed data to another field in the model. The `validator` functions should be independent, and each should only work with its designated field.

However, you can perform transformations on the field the `validator` is defined for. For instance, instead of validating the existence of IDs and returning them, you can manipulate this function to return the actual Server objects if they exist:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
from typing import List
from myproject.domain.repositories import ServerRepository

class Server(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

class LoadBalancerCreate(BaseModel):   
    name: str
    servers: List[Server] = []

    @validator('servers', pre=True)  
    def servers_must_exist(cls, server_ids):
        server_repo = ServerRepository()
        servers = []
        for server_id in server_ids:
            server = server_repo.get_by_id(server_id)
            if server is None:
                raise ValueError(f"Server with id {server_id} does not exist")
            servers.append(server)
        return servers
```

Here, the `servers` field is of the type `List[Server]`, and the input is being transformed from a list of IDs to a list of Server models. By using `pre=True` in the `validator` decorator, we tell Pydantic that this is a pre-validator that modifies the input data before any other validation is done.

Please note that this approach will increase the coupling between your models and your repositories, which might not be the best practice. It might be better to perform these kinds of operations outside of your models, i.e., in a service layer. This way, your models will not have dependencies on other parts of your system and will be easier to test and maintain. It all depends on the complexity of your system and your overall architectural design.

User: 
They say  @validator is deprecated and I sshould use @field_validator
```python
@validator('server_ids',
           each_item=True)  #
```


Assistant: 
I apologize for any confusion, but as of the current release of Pydantic at the time of this response (1.8.2), the `@validator` decorator is not deprecated. The official Pydantic documentation and source code do not mention any deprecation of the `@validator` decorator.

The usage of the `@validator` decorator is as follows:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class MyModel(BaseModel):
    name: str

    @validator('name')
    def name_must_be_alphanumeric(cls, v):
        # your validation logic here
        return v
```

If there's a newer version of Pydantic that has deprecated this decorator, it's likely that the documentation for that version will provide guidance on what to use instead. However, at present there is no `@field_validator` in Pydantic.

If you happen to see a deprecation warning regarding this in your IDE or in your runtime logs, could you please provide the exact text or a screenshot of the warning? That could help me better understand the source of the confusion and provide a more accurate solution.

Also, it could be helpful to check your Pydantic version by running `pip show pydantic` in your terminal to make sure you have the latest version installed.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns!

User: 
I use pydantic 2

Assistant: 
I apologize for the confusion earlier. As of the version of Pydantic available at the time of this writing, the `@validator` decorator is the standard way to add custom validation to Pydantic models. However, it appears that there has been a breaking change introduced in the version you're using.

If your version mentions using `@field_validator` instead of `@validator`, you may use it. Here is how you can use `field_validator` generally:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator
from typing import List

class Server(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

class LoadBalancer(BaseModel):
    name: str
    server_ids: List[str] 

    @field_validator('server_ids', each_item=True)
    def validate_server_ids(cls, server_ids):
        server_repo = ServerRepository()
        for server_id in server_ids:
            server = server_repo.get_by_id(server_id)
            if server is None:
                raise ValueError(f"Server with id {server_id} does not exist")
        return server_ids
```

The `@field_validator` decorator works similarly to the `@validator` decorator. The first parameter is the name of the field that the function will validate, and if `each_item=True` is passed, the function will validate each item of that field (if the field is a sequence of values).

Please adapt this example to your specific case and refer to the documentation that comes with your version of Pydantic for further details. I recommend routinely checking for updates with newer versions for any critical dependency libraries to ensure your code doesn't unexpectedly break due to deprecations or updates.
